## 🚨 Issue Summary 🚨

**Duration of Outage:** June 23, 2024, 14:00 - June 23, 2024, 15:30 UTC

**Impact:** 
Our beloved WordPress site, the jewel of our LAMP stack, decided to take an unexpected nap. This resulted in a full service disruption. Imagine 100% of our users staring at the dreaded 500 Internal Server Error screen, unable to access our blog, e-commerce platform, and customer support portal. Not fun.

**Root Cause:** 
A tiny typo in the `wp-settings.php` file. Yes, a humble typo. Someone typed `phpp` instead of `php`. Who knew an extra 'p' could cause so much trouble?

## ⏰ Timeline ⏰

- **14:00** - 🚨 Issue detected via monitoring alert. Panic mode activated.
- **14:05** - 🔍 On-call engineer jumps into action.
- **14:10** - 🧐 Server logs examined. 500 errors everywhere.
- **14:20** - 🤔 Investigating recent plugin updates (red herring alert).
- **14:30** - 📞 Escalated to web development team. "We need backup!"
- **14:40** - 🔍 Found the typo in `wp-settings.php`. Facepalm ensues.
- **14:50** - 🛠️ Fixed the typo. Celebrations begin.
- **15:00** - 🤖 Created Puppet script to automate the fix. Because we’re fancy like that.
- **15:20** - 🚀 Deployed Puppet script. We’re back in business.
- **15:30** - ✅ Full service restored. High fives all around.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Root Cause and Resolution 🕵️‍♀️

**Root Cause:**
Our WordPress installation had a sneaky little typo in the `wp-settings.php` file. The incorrect `phpp` extensions wreaked havoc, preventing the Apache server from loading the necessary PHP modules. The result? A catastrophic 500 error.

**Resolution:**
We donned our detective hats and corrected the typo. To ensure this doesn’t happen again, we whipped up a nifty Puppet script to automate the fix:

```puppet
exec { 'fix-wordpress':
  command => 'sed -i s/phpp/php/g /var/www/html/wp-settings.php',
  path    => '/usr/local/bin/:/bin/'
}
```

Problem solved. Crisis averted.

## 🔧 Corrective and Preventative Measures 🔧

**Improvements/Fixes:**
- Implement stricter syntax checking during deployments.
- Enhance monitoring to catch these sneaky syntax errors.
- Regular audits of critical configuration files.

**To-Do List:**
1. **Patch WordPress Configuration:** Hunt down and exterminate all syntax errors.
2. **Add Monitoring:** Keep a vigilant eye on key configuration files.
3. **Automate Fixes:** Use Puppet to zap common errors before they cause trouble.
4. **Review Deployment Process:** Add automated syntax checks to our deployment routine.
5. **Conduct Training:** Make sure our dev team knows their `php` from their `phpp`.

## 🎉 Conclusion 🎉

Thanks for joining us on this wild debugging adventure. We hope you enjoyed the ride as much as we enjoyed fixing it. Stay tuned for more tales from the trenches of system engineering!
